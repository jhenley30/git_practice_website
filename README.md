This is a sample website made as part of the [*Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous* tutorial](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial).  This is my second time through the tutorial in an effort to up my efficiency it the use of git and my github account. 

I had run into some very basic problems that served as good learning opportunities that I didn't experience the first time through the tutorial.  The primary problem being that I started using my github account on a different computer from the one I am currently working on.  When I tried to initialize a new repository for the project in this tutorial I was recieving this error message:

 "Permission denied (publickey).

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights

and the repository exists."

After a bit of digging I found that I had not setup a new SSH key in my terminal or in my github account once I began working on this new Mac.  It was a simple fix after I knew what the problem was.  This issue allowed me to learn about SSH keys and how to navigate all the online forums searching for solutions.  It's nice realizing that all of the errors or issues I incur have happened previously to many before me, it's more a matter of formatting my questions concisely to get to the answer quickly.
